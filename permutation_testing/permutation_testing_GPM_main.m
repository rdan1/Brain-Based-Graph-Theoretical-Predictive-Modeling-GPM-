%%        BRAIN-BASED GRAPH-THEORETICAL PREDICTIVE MODELING (GPM)
%   The GPM employs graph theory to define brain predictors of a phenotype (e.g., behavior, symptom), within a cross-validation framework.
%   Graph-theoretical measures are computed from the brain's functional connectome.
%   
%   Working and null models: 
%           The script includes a comparison of the GPM ('working model') to a corresponding null model. The null model is defined as the same cross-validated model but without the brain predictors.
%           This is relevant for predictive models that include covariates other than the graph-theoretical predictors (e.g., baseline clinical scores, sex, age).
%           It allows for testing the added effect of the brain graph-theoretical predictors beyond the effect of the covariates.
%
%   Required inputs:
%           all_phenotype (y): a phenotype to predict (e.g., behavior, cognition, clinical symptom)
%           all_graph (x): a matrix with graph-theoretical measures (can be computed using the BCT) 
%
%   Outputs:
%           yhat: predicted scores.
%           MSE, correlation: predictive performance metrics

%%     This script includes permutation testing to obtain a p value for correlation between predicted and observed scores.
%         If correlation is used as a predictive performance metric, p value should be obtained through permutation testing.
